1. Data Ingestion
We will use a python stomp client that we will run in lambda.
This will then push those messages in an AMS SQS queue
This should provide reliable and scalable ingestion.

2. Data Transformation
We can then get messages from the queue and transform them using another lambda function

3. Data Storage
Depending on the type of data retrieval needed we can either output the transformed data in an S3 bucket or in an RDS database.
Both solutions provides scalability and reliable backups.
